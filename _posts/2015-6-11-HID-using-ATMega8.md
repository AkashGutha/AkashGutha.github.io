__What is HID?__
HID stands for `Human interface device`. Any device that a human uses to interact with a computer can come under this category of human interface devices. You might be knowing these by other names such as `Human machine interfaces`. More advanced implementations include `Brain machine interfaces`. 

__What is this porject about?__
This project is about creating an interaction device, that a person can use to interact with the computer. In this project we specifically used an accelerometer capture data from hand movement and translate it into Mouse movement.
