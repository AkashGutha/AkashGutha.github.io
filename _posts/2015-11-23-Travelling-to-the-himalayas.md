We took the bus and got down at the start of Rohtang pass. <br />
The wind was chill, and the weather was harsh.  <br />
We were four kilometres above sea level, and the lack of oxygen made us breathe harder.  <br />
Clouds were flowing a few meters above our heads, and the white snow seemed never to end.  <br />
In an instant, the bus disappeared and left us with nothing but silence.  <br />
Every direction was a piece of art as if someone painted it to be perfect.  <br />
Hidden inside the art was the terror of nature.  <br />
The more we enjoyed it, the fiercer it seemed to get.  <br />

While we were busy enjoying the Himalayas, a person in army dress appeared out of nowhere. We had a little chat with him, and he told us that there was an army camp after a few kilometres into the pass. "It is insane to think of even staying there for a day, and the army has camped here?" I asked myself, and maybe sacrifice of such people is the reason that I can dream to have a prosperous life.
