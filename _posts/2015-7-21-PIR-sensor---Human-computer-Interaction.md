# PIR HID
__What is a PIR sensor ?__
A passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. They are most often used in PIR-based motion detectors.

__Does PIR sensor detect static warm objects ?__
No. It can only detect warm and moving objects.

__Does PIR sensor give you a sense of direction ?__
No. They do not.
But, you can always have multiple sensors in place and find the direction by checking the order they fire up.
