__What is Osteoporosis?__
Osteoporosis is a disease where increased bone weakness increases the risk of a broken bone. It is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly. Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bones of the forearm, and the hip.

__Is there any middle stage?__
Yes. it's called Osteopenia.
Osteopenia is a condition in which bone mineral density is lower than normal. It is considered by many doctors to be a precursor to osteoporosis. However, not every person diagnosed with osteopenia will develop osteoporosis.

__Who are the common victims?__
Osteoporosis becomes more common with age.According to Wikipedia, About 15% of white people in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected. It is more common in women than men. In the developed world, depending on the method of diagnosis, 2% to 8% of males and 9% to 38% of females are affected.
In my personal experience women especially elderly mothers (my own mother) are the main victims.

__Is this curable?__
At the time of writing, No. 

__Is it controllable?__
At the time of writing. Some techniques might work, but not for everyone.

__How do we tackle this issue?__
Premature care has shown positive effects. So, this research's the aim is to collect data from existing pateinets and use it to predict the probability that a person might develop Osteoporosis.

__How do we collect the data?__
There are many ways we can get meaningful data regarding Osteporosis. Many of them are invasive or require heavy equipment. But for this experiemnt, i teamed up with a friend of mine. We gather frequency of vibration from the [Tibial bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia) using impulses from a medical hammer and an accelerometer.
