# The Journey

The very first robot that i built was a simple four wheeled robots that had no __intelligent__ electronic design involved. I learnt building it from a robotics workshop conducted by my seniors at my university. The robot had a remote control and a long strand of wires hanging to connect it to the robot. We used a `Lithium-Ion battery 12V 20AH` enough to keep our robot running for an hour.

__Simple Robot__


After building this I and my team took it to a few events to participate. It did perform well :smile: but never won because, we never built it to win competitions. we were satisfied by the output.

__Line Folowing Robots__

After playing around with the same robot for another month. I came across `Line following robots (LFRs)`. They were instantly interesting to me becuase were everything i dreamt of doing as a kid `to build something cool using both hardware and software`. I was still in the first year and wasn't much aware of electronics in practice and this was a great experience.


__Hover Craft__
After taking our new robot the `LFR` to other competiitons in our nearby colleges, I and my team decided to participate in a Bigger TechFests and `IIT Bombay` was the perfect destination. We registered our team on the site for the `Line following Hoverbot Competiton` and started building our first `Hoverbot`

__Communication Protocls__
After playing around with line following robots, I found that i'm more interested in programming the microcontroller than building robots.
