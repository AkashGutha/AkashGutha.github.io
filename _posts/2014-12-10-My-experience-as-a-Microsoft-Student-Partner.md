__The journey__

It all began with my interest in making games. I was playing around with the Unity game engine adn build small games. Right around 2013 i've bought my first smart phone (Lumia 520) and started building games for the windows phone platform. Though i didn't deploy any games to the store, all of them were pracatice and fun projects. 

Then one day i came across a Microsoft competition on building games for windows phone. I was excited and got on board, started creating a game. I created the a game called __Fruit Smash__(Unfortunately now not available, since it was taken down during the last year's store cleanup). My submission crossed the first level of scrutiny and i was awarded a __Windows 8.1 pro edition license__ and a free __Life time Developer account__ for the windows store.

I got excited about the developer account and started building apps for the windows phone store. it was a good experience and the first time i started building any kind of application. Later while going through a facebook post i came across the __Microsoft student partner__ competition and read through the requirements. It was simple, One app ppublished on any windows platform, which i already had ready. I applied to the competition and voila, after a month i was selected as a __Microsft student partner__.

This wasn't the fun part though. THe fun part was the __Student Summit__

It was a great oppurtunity to meet young and senior developers in one palce and interact with them.
