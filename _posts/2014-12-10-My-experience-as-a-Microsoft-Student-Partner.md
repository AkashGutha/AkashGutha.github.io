__The journey__

It all began with my interest in making games. I started playing around with Unity game engine and built small games. Right around 2013 i bought my first smart phone (Lumia 520) and started building games for the windows phone platform. Though i didn't deploy any games to the store, all of them were for pracatice and fun projects. 

Then one day i came across a Microsoft competition on building games for windows phone. I was excited and got on board, started creating a game. I created a game called __Fruit Smash__ (Unfortunately not available now, since it was taken down during the a store cleanup). My submission crossed the first level of scrutiny and i was awarded a __Windows 8.1 pro edition license__ and a free __Life time Developer account__ for the windows store.

I got excited about the developer account and started building apps for the windows phone store. it was a good experience and the first time building any kind of application. Later while going through a facebook post i came across the __Microsoft student partner__ competition and read through the requirements. It was simple, One functional and creative app ppublished on any windows platform, which i already had ready. I applied to the competition and voila, after a month i was selected as a __Microsft student partner__.

This wasn't the fun part though. The fun part was the __Student Summit__

It was a great oppurtunity to meet young and senior developers and interact with them. Below you can find some pictures from the event.
