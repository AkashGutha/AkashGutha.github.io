__What is this project about?__
This research is a Proof of concept of creating digital components using Neural networks. These components if successfully fabricated onto a silicon chip, would show significant performance improvements.

__What is the Idea behind this project?__
The idea behind this research is to model digital components as weighted networks of connections between nodes. These nodes and weights are then modeled using Neural networks. The resulting network is then translated into an electronic design that can be fabricated onto a silicon chip. Now, Once we model the component into a Neural network the implementation is really up to the company or engineer taking this forward.
