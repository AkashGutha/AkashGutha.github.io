__What is this project about?__
This research is a Proof of concept ofcreating digital components using Neural networks. These components if succesfully fabricated onto a silicon chip, would show siginificant performance improvememnts.

__How did i achieve this?__
The idea behind this research is to model digital components as weighted netowrks of connections between nodes. These nodes and weights are then modeled using Neural networs. The resulting network is then translated into an electronic design that ca be fabricated onto a silicon chip.
