__What is this project about?__
This research is a Proof of concept ofcreating digital components using Neural networks. These components if succesfully fabricated onto a silicon chip, would show siginificant performance improvememnts.

__What is the Idea behind this project?__
The idea behind this research is to model digital components as weighted networks of connections between nodes. These nodes and weights are then modeled using Neural networks. The resulting network is then translated into an electronic design that can be fabricated onto a silicon chip. Now, Once we model the component into a Neural netowrk the implementation is really upto the company or engineer taking this forward.
